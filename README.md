This program generates solutions for the card game 'Set' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)).

Set is an interesting game in the sense that it is both played in real-time and relies almost entirely on the power of human perception, this makes it a difficult game to efficiently play from a computational perspective.

At the moment my algorithm is a simple series of nested for loops, however as and when I find computational 'shortcuts' I will use them to make the program more efficient. 
In the meantime have fun, and please don't try to use this to win actual games of Set, unless you have a very good typing speed and can input cards at lightning efficiency.
