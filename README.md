This Java project generates solutions for the card game 'Set' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)).

Set is an interesting game in the sense that it is both played in real-time, and finding solutions quickly is dependent on the human ability to analyse multiple cards simultaneously. Computationally this makes finding solutions woefully inefficient, and this is a game where the human really has the edge on the computer (at least in theory).

At the moment my algorithm is a simple series of nested for loops, however as and when I find computational 'shortcuts' I will use them to make the program more efficient. 
In the meantime have fun, and please don't try to use this to win actual games of Set, unless you have a very good typing speed and can input cards at some insane rate. Perhaps instead you could play the game with your own eagle eyes and mental reflexes, and engage with your family and peers as well!
